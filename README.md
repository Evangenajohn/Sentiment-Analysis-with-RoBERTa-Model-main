# Sentimental Analysis
## *Basic Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa Pre-trained Model:*
This project outlines a basic approach to sentiment analysis using the powerful RoBERTa pre-trained model, along with SciPy and NumPy libraries 
for numerical computations and prediction conversions.

#### *RoBERTa*:
The RoBERTa model was proposed in RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining 
Approach by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Googleâ€™s BERT model released in 2018.
It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

#### *SciPy*:
SciPy is a free and open-source Python library for scientific computing. It builds on top of the NumPy library, providing a vast collection of functions for 
Optimization, Integration, Interpolation, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Signal and Image Processing, etc.

#### *NumPy*:
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a foundational open-source Python library for scientific computing.
It provides powerful multidimensional arrays and efficient tools for manipulating numerical data, making it essential for data science, machine learning, and other computationally intensive fields.

#### *How to make it work:*
##### *STEP 1*:
Install and Import Necessary Libraries:
- `pip install transformers numpy`
- `import transformers`
- `from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaForSequenceClassification`
- `import numpy as np`

#### *STEP 2*:
Prompt the user for input text.

#### *STEP 3*:
Let the model work on the given statement and predict it.

#### *STEP 4*:
*Output*:

### *Additional Considerations:*

- Fine-tuning RoBERTa on your own sentiment-annotated data can improve accuracy for your specific use case.
- Explore more advanced NLP techniques for pre-processing and explore different pre-trained RoBERTa models for sentiment analysis.
- Consider handling edge cases like empty or nonsensical input.

### *Further Exploration:*

- Experiment with different pre-trained RoBERTa models or fine-tune your own.
- Explore more sophisticated pre-processing techniques for text cleaning.
- Integrate this code into a larger application for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.
